# Arduino-FVM

This library provides a token threaded Forth kernel that may be
embedded in Arduino sketches. The kernel can be used as a debug
shell or even full scale Forth applications.

The virtual machine allows multi-tasking and easy to integrate with
the Arduino core library functions.

Please note that this is work in progress.

## Install

Download and unzip the Arduino-FVM library into your sketchbook
libraries directory. Rename from Arduino-FVM-master to FVM.

The FVM library and examples should be found in the Arduino IDE
File>Examples menu.
